## Optimization Settings

Dma.c should use the same optimization settings as other functions
called from the MtrCtrl ISR (generally, optimize = 3, optimize for speed
= 5).

# Architectural Concerns

DMA is a module that largely impacts the system architecture,
particularly at the MtrCtrl ISR time domain. As such, this section
includes some considerations for integrating DMA into an integration
project for the first time.

The examples show integration of every DMA channel; if only a subset is
used, not all of these examples may apply.

## Overall DMA Architecture

The following diagram is taken from FDD52, and shows how the DMA
channels fit into the MtrCtrl ISR process:

![](ElectricPowerSteering_TexasInstruments_HAITEC_LC_website/docs/Dma/doc/mediax/media/image1.emf)

## Affected Modules

### IoHwAbstractionUsr

Historically, ADC conversions were triggered by the 2ms loop through the
MtrCtrl ISR (the MtrCtrl ISR would perform a software trigger to the
“slow” ADC groups directly). With DMA, the “slow” ADC group conversion
is now triggered by ePWM SOCB, driven by ePWM4 using CMPB.

In this new architecture, IoHwAbstractionUsr must perform the following:

1.  Before CDDInterface_Per1, an IoHwAbstractionUsr runnable must update
    the value of ePWM4 CMPB (refer to the ePWM component for the
    interface). It must also clear the ADC1 G2 Conversions Ended bit as
    follows:

> adcREG1-\>GxSR\[2u\] = 1u;

1.  After the conversion completes, an IoHwAbstractionUsr runnable must
    update the value of ePWM4 CMPB to disable the ADC conversion (refer
    to the ePWM component).

2.  After the conversion completes but before the ADC values are
    required to be used, an IoHwAbstractionUsr runnable must read and
    process the data from the DMA destination buffer. The buffer can
    optionally be cleared at this point. Note that this can be done from
    the same runnable as disabling the ADC conversion.

3.  An IoHwAbstraction runnable can be called from the MtrCtrl ISR to
    capture any data from the “fast” ADC conversion needed by the 2ms
    loop (ex. a redundant read of switched battery voltage). The DMA
    buffer should be copied to a standard CDDInterface global variable
    and read by CDDInterface_Per1 along with the rest of the MtrCtrl ISR
    data used by the 2ms loop.

The final IoHwAbstractionUsr component could then look something like
this:

IoHwAb_CaptureADC – reads Switched Battery Voltage from ADC2 DMA buffer
and writes it to a CDD variable.

IoHwAb_StartADC – enables the ADC1 conversion and clears the ADC1 G2
Conversions Ended bit. Scheduled in the 2ms loop just before
CDDInterface_Per1.

IoHwAb_ReadADC – checks that the ADC1 conversion completed and disables
the ADC1 conversion. Reads the values from the ADC1 DMA buffer as well
as the redundant Switched Battery Voltage from CDDInterface. Converts
all of these signals to engineering units and outputs them to the rest
of the RTE. Scheduled in the 2ms loop at the end of the forward path.
See ePWM component for minimum elapsed time between enabling and
disabling the ADC conversion via the write of the ePWM4 CMPB value.

### Adc

The intended DMA architecture uses two ADC conversion groups: ADC1 Group
2 (“slow” ADC) and ADC2 Group 1 (“fast” ADC). Historically, ADC2 Event
Group was used instead of ADC2 Group 1 – this may mean that integrating
DMA will require a program to switch the ADC group being used.

### MtrCtrl_Irq

If this is the first integration of DMA into a program, the existing ADC
triggering mechanism will need to be removed and replaced with the
method described above. This will largely involve calling an
IoHwAbstractionUsr runnable. In addition, the ADC Conversion Complete
flag will still need to be cleared (though it may have changed, see
above), as well as the DMA interrupt that calls the MtrCtrl ISR. It can
be cleared as follows:

DMACTRLREG-\>BTCFLAG = (1 \<\< 3)

### uDiag

The following entries should be added to the Static Register Check list.

are enabled.
